# Main idea
    Making your solar system fabulous. Better
items, strenght. (Maybe sth educational)

    Everything starts with a sun. We can build up
to four planets. We can upgrade them. Fusion
system. 
    Enemies:
	TODO 

    Story:
	Fairytale... :) 
    
# Game cycles
    1. Solar system building 
	-- up to 4 planets
	-- place for upgrades
	-- constant world
	-- load/save game
	-- big planets and sun
	-- limited to the solar system
    2. Upgrades
	-- with progression planets become more beautiful
    3. Enemies
    4. Fusion system 

# Unspecified game cycles
    1. GUI
    2. Audio
    3. Networking (Maybe)
    4. 3DS importer

# Ideas
    -- Maybe TD waves
    -- Environment - 3D objects + plane textures

Progress videos
?- every 2 weeks

2 weeks cycle


Solar system attacked by creeps
-- give loot (resources)
-- 


Resources
-- Upgrades 
    passive
    expensive
-- Skills (Fusion)
    control over the situation
    active
    cheaper

TODO: 
    1. Fix the problem with the picking of the satellites
	-- Strange precision loss
	-- When camera is at an angle, I should do ray-ellipsoid collision detection.
	   The first radius of the ellipsoid would be the circle's radius and the 
	   second - the circle\'s radius * sin(cameraAngle)?
    2. Remove framework files which I don't need.
